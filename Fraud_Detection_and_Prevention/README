## 1. Understanding the Requirements
- **Define Fraud Types**: Identify specific types of fraud such as credit card fraud, identity theft, and other relevant types to target.
- **Data Assessment**: Determine the datasets required for analysis. This may include transaction histories, user behavior data, account details, etc.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Understand and integrate compliance requirements relevant to banking and financial data.

## 2. Setting up the AWS Environment with Terraform
- **AWS Account Setup**: Ensure AWS account access and familiarize with the AWS Management Console.
- **Terraform Scripting**: Write Terraform scripts to define the necessary AWS resources for the project. This includes instances, storage solutions, and other services.
- **IAM Configuration**: Set up secure access to AWS services using IAM roles and policies.

## 3. Data Collection and Storage
- **S3 Bucket Configuration**: Set up S3 buckets for data storage with appropriate access and security policies.
- **Data Ingestion**: Implement data ingestion pipelines using AWS Glue or Data Pipeline to collect data from various sources and store it in S3.

## 4. Data Processing with PySpark and Transformation with dbt
- **Amazon EMR Setup**: Configure EMR for data processing. Install and set up PySpark on EMR clusters.
- **PySpark Processing**: Use PySpark to perform initial data processing tasks including data cleaning, normalization, and preliminary analysis.
- **dbt Setup**: Configure dbt for AWS and connect it to your data warehouse, such as Amazon Redshift.
- **dbt Transformations**: Utilize dbt to write models for performing complex data transformations, aggregations, and preparing the dataset for advanced modeling.

## 5. Data Orchestration with Apache Airflow
- **Airflow Configuration**: Set up Apache Airflow, ideally using Terraform for automation. Configure it to manage and schedule ETL pipelines effectively.
- **Creating DAGs**: Develop Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Airflow to automate the entire ETL process, which includes running dbt transformation jobs.

## 6. Feature Engineering and Model Development
- **Feature Selection**: Employ Amazon SageMaker to select and engineer features that are most relevant to detecting instances of fraud.
- **Model Development**: Use SageMakerâ€™s built-in algorithms or custom models to develop machine learning models suitable for fraud detection.

## 7. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Training Models**: Utilize the prepared dataset in Amazon SageMaker to train your models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Test the models against a validation set and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## 8. Model Deployment
- **Deploying Models**: Deploy the trained model using Amazon SageMaker Endpoints for real-time predictions.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Set up Amazon CloudWatch and SageMaker Model Monitor to continually monitor the model's performance and to detect any data quality issues.

## 9. Integration with Applications
- **API Development**: Use Amazon API Gateway for developing APIs that expose the fraud detection model.
- **Application Integration**: Ensure that the fraud detection system is integrated with the internal banking systems to facilitate real-time fraud analysis and detection.

## 10. Continuous Improvement and Maintenance
- **Model Updates**: Regularly update and retrain the model with new data to maintain its relevance and accuracy.
- **Regulatory Monitoring**: Continually monitor the system to ensure it complies with evolving financial regulations and standards.

## 11. CI/CD and Version Control
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for the automated testing and deployment of Terraform and dbt changes.
- **Version Control**: Manage all code and configurations (including Terraform scripts, dbt models, Airflow DAGs, and SageMaker model codes) in a version control system like Git.

## 12. Testing, Documentation, and Collaboration
- **Systematic Testing**: Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing throughout the development process.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of the architecture, codebase, data models, operational procedures, and any other critical aspects of the project.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Regularly engage and collaborate with key stakeholders, including data scientists, IT professionals, security teams, and compliance officers to ensure cohesive development and deployment of the fraud detection system.
